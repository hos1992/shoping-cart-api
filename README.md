-   I uploaded the .env file all you need to do change the config for ( database ).
-   After the pull make sure you composer update,migrate the database and seed the ProductSeeder class;
-   the postman collection link => https://www.getpostman.com/collections/a3fa090420818cfce46f
-   i used repository design pattern for this task,
-   all this shopping cart and check out sycle don't require a user to be logged in but the database schema is created to handle the logged in users also.
-   the key session_id can be the mobile device token if it's a mobile app.
-   place-order API is the checkout method.
